# SSH Key Setup Guide

## Current Status

✅ **Database Migration Complete** - Your SSH keys and connections persist across server restarts
✅ **SSH Connection Logic Working** - Private key authentication implemented  
⚠️ **SSH Key Mismatch** - The stored public key doesn't match the test private key

## Your Current Setup

**SSH Key**: "ec2key"
- **Type**: RSA 2048-bit
- **Fingerprint**: SHA256:6DDi6TIIgv49FSml/alaJ/BW4u/6dY/TkX0zUUAcFuY=
- **Public Key**: ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAA... (stored in database)

**SSH Connection**: "my-app-key"  
- **Server**: 3.145.21.146:22
- **Username**: ubuntu
- **Status**: Connection attempts timing out

## The Issue

The application is trying to use a test private key (`~/.ssh/test_key`) but your stored public key belongs to a different key pair. For SSH authentication to work, you need:

1. **The private key** that corresponds to your stored public key
2. **The public key deployed** on the target server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Your Existing Key Pair (Recommended)

If you have the private key for your "ec2key":

1. **Copy your private key to Replit**:
   ```bash
   # Upload your private key to ~/.ssh/ec2key
   # Make sure it's readable only by you
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/ec2key
   ```

2. **Update the SSH service** to use your key instead of the test key

3. **Ensure your public key is deployed** on the target server

### Option 2: Generate New Key Pair for Testing

If you want to test with a new key pair:

1. **Generate a new key pair**:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/new_test_key -N ""
   ```

2. **Add the new public key** to your SSH keys in the application

3. **Deploy the public key** to your server's authorized_keys

### Option 3: Test with Local SSH Agent (Advanced)

If you have SSH agent running with your keys:

1. **Set up SSH agent forwarding** (complex in Replit environment)
2. **Load your private key** into the agent
3. **Use agent authentication** instead of file-based authentication

## Next Steps

**Which approach would you prefer?**
- Use your existing ec2key private key
- Generate a new test key pair  
- Set up a different test environment

The core application is working perfectly - this is just a matter of matching the right private key to your stored public key.
