Perfect! Let’s do a **demo scenario showing auto-detection and selection for existing items**. This shows how the app can guide the user without requiring guesswork.

---

## **Scenario:** User wants to run the backend container after everything has been built and the network created

---

### **Step 1: User clicks “Run Backend Container” button**

**App explanation:**

> “We will start the backend container and connect it to your existing Docker network.
> You can select from existing networks and images that were already created.”

---

### **Step 2: App auto-detects existing items**

**Auto-detected networks:**

```text
Available Docker networks:
1. campusmingle-net
2. bridge
3. host
Select network [1-3]:
```

**Auto-detected images:**

```text
Available Docker images:
1. campusmingle-backend
2. campusmingle-frontend
3. postgres
Select image [1-3]:
```

---

### **Step 3: App prompts user input**

| Input                 | Guidance                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<BACKEND_CONTAINER>` | Name for the new backend container. Example: `backend_app`         |
| `<NETWORK_NAME>`      | Select from the list of existing networks detected by the app      |
| `<BACKEND_IMAGE>`     | Select from the list of existing Docker images detected by the app |

**User selects / enters:**

```
BACKEND_CONTAINER = backend_app
NETWORK_NAME = campusmingle-net  (select option 1)
BACKEND_IMAGE = campusmingle-backend  (select option 1)
```

---

### **Step 4: App executes command**

```bash
docker run -d --name backend_app --network campusmingle-net backend_app
```

**App output:**

```
Container backend_app started successfully
```

---

### **Step 5: Viewing logs for auto-detected container**

**App explanation:**

> “You can check the logs of your running backend container to confirm it started correctly.”

**App shows list of running containers (auto-detected):**

```text
Running containers:
1. frontend_app
2. backend_app
Select container to view logs [1-2]:
```

**User selects:**

```
2
```

**Command executed:**

```bash
docker logs -f backend_app
```

**App output:**

```
> backend_app started on port 8000
> Connected to database postgres
```

### ✅ **Key Features in This Scenario**

1. **App auto-detects existing networks, images, and containers**.
2. **User chooses from a list**, no need to remember names.
3. **New items still require input**, with clear instructions and examples.
4. **Prevents errors** from typos or incorrect values.
5. **Maintains learning environment** for juniors, while being fast for seniors.

---

If you want, I can **combine both scenarios** (new inputs + existing items) into a **full step-by-step Docker workflow demo**, showing the **complete experience of a user in the app**.

Do you want me to do that next?
