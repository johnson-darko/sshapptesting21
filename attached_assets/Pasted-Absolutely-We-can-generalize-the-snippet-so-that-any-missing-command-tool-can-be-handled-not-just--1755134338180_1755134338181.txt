Absolutely! We can generalize the snippet so that any missing command/tool can be handled, not just Docker. The app can detect the missing command, explain it, suggest installation, and ask for confirmation before taking action. Here’s a generalized version:

#!/bin/bash

# Function to run a command and handle errors with user confirmation
run_command() {
    local cmd="$1"
    echo "Executing: $cmd"
    
    # Run the command
    eval "$cmd"
    local exit_code=$?

    # Check exit code and suggest actions
    case $exit_code in
        0)
            echo "✅ Command succeeded."
            ;;
        1)
            echo "❌ General error: Check syntax or dependencies. See above for details."
            ;;
        2)
            echo "❌ Misuse of shell builtin or invalid option. Please check the command."
            ;;
        126)
            echo "⚠️ Command found but not executable."
            read -p "Do you want to fix permissions and try again? (y/n): " confirm
            if [[ "$confirm" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
                chmod +x $(echo $cmd | awk '{print $1}')
                echo "Permissions updated. Please run the command again."
            fi
            ;;
        127)
            local missing_tool=$(echo $cmd | awk '{print $1}')
            echo "⚠️ Command '$missing_tool' not found."
            read -p "Do you want to try installing '$missing_tool'? (y/n): " confirm
            if [[ "$confirm" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
                # Auto-detect OS and install the missing tool
                if command -v apt >/dev/null 2>&1; then
                    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y $missing_tool
                elif command -v yum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
                    sudo yum install -y $missing_tool
                elif command -v dnf >/dev/null 2>&1; then
                    sudo dnf install -y $missing_tool
                elif command -v pacman >/dev/null 2>&1; then
                    sudo pacman -S --noconfirm $missing_tool
                else
                    echo "Package manager not detected. Please install '$missing_tool' manually."
                fi
            else
                echo "Skipping installation of '$missing_tool'."
            fi
            ;;
        128)
            echo "❌ Invalid argument to exit. Check script or command usage."
            ;;
        130)
            echo "⚠️ Command terminated by user (Ctrl+C)."
            ;;
        255)
            echo "❌ Script or command failed with exit code 255. Check logs above."
            ;;
        *)
            echo "❌ Command failed with exit code $exit_code. Check output above."
            ;;
    esac
}

# Example usage:
run_command "docker --version"
run_command "git --version"
run_command "python3 --version"

# User-typed command
# read -p "Enter your custom command: " user_cmd
# run_command "$user_cmd"
✅ Features of this generalized version
Detects any command/tool not installed.

Explains the problem to the user.

Suggests installation automatically but requires user confirmation.

Works for Docker, Git, Python, Node.js, or any CLI tool.

Handles permissions issues (exit code 126) and other common errors.

If you want, I can combine this with your AI English-to-command interface so that:

The app interprets user instructions in plain English.

Executes the corresponding command.

Detects errors and suggests fixes with confirmation, all in a generalized, multi-tool workflow.
