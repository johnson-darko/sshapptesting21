Project Timeline & Phases for Your AI-Powered Terminal Assistant

⸻

Phase 1: Basic SSH Command Execution & AI Command Generation

Duration: 2–3 weeks
Goal: Connect to remote server, send commands, get output, and generate commands from plain English.
	•	Setup secure SSH connection with keys (AWS EC2)
	•	Build a simple backend API to run commands remotely and capture output
	•	Integrate AI model API (OpenAI GPT) to convert plain-English input into shell commands
	•	Simple frontend to send command requests and display real-time output

⸻

Phase 2: Command Queueing, Error Detection, and Basic Self-Healing

Duration: 3–4 weeks
Goal: Manage command execution flow, detect errors, and auto-install missing dependencies.
	•	Implement command queue & async processing (e.g., Redis, BullMQ, or Celery)
	•	Parse command output for errors and missing dependencies
	•	Trigger AI to generate install/fix commands automatically
	•	Retry commands after fixes, log all attempts
	•	Improve frontend to show execution status, errors, and retries

⸻

Phase 3: Auto-Documentation Engine & Versioning

Duration: 3 weeks
Goal: Record all commands, outputs, and AI interpretations into versioned docs.
	•	Design documentation data schema (markdown or JSON)
	•	Generate human-readable explanations from AI
	•	Compare with previous doc versions and update incrementally
	•	Store docs with version control (Git or database)
	•	Add export options (PDF, markdown)
	•	Dashboard views for docs and history

⸻

Phase 4: Advanced Dashboard & User Interaction

Duration: 3–4 weeks
Goal: Build a polished user interface with chat interaction, dashboards, and logs.
	•	Real-time terminal output streaming
	•	Chat-style interface for plain-English commands & follow-ups
	•	Visual diffing for documentation changes
	•	SSH key management & multi-server support
	•	User authentication & session management

⸻

Phase 5: Git Integration & Collaboration Features

Duration: 2–3 weeks
Goal: Enable pushing docs and code to GitHub repos, handle pull/push workflows.
	•	Automate git pull, merge conflict detection, and push commands
	•	Detect dependency changes after pull and auto-install
	•	Document git workflows automatically
	•	Notifications for conflicts, test failures, or approvals
	•	Collaboration dashboards for teams

⸻

Phase 6: Polishing, Security & Scalability

Duration: 3 weeks
Goal: Harden security, improve performance, and prepare for real users.
	•	Secure storage of SSH keys and tokens
	•	Rate limiting, logging, and monitoring
	•	Load testing & scalability optimizations
	•	User onboarding and help docs
	•	Collect user feedback for improvements

Notes:
	•	You can overlap some phases if you have a team.
	•	This timeline assumes a small team or solo developer working part-time/full-time.
	•	MVP ready for early demos around 3–4 months if you prioritize Phase 1–3 first.

If you want, I can help you write detailed specs for each phase or generate starter code/tasks for the initial phases. How would you like to proceed?
