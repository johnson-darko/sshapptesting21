Great question! To have SSH connections to users’ terminals secure and seamless like GitHub, here’s how you can handle SSH keys and authentication properly:

⸻

How GitHub Does It (and Best Practice)
	1.	User generates SSH key pair locally

	•	Users create a public/private key pair on their own machine using ssh-keygen.
	•	The private key stays on their machine and is never shared.
	•	The public key is uploaded/shared with the remote service (e.g., GitHub).

	2.	User uploads public key to the service

	•	GitHub lets users add their public SSH keys to their account settings.
	•	When a user tries to connect, GitHub verifies the connection using that public key.

	3.	Authentication via SSH key pair

	•	The SSH client uses the private key to prove identity.
	•	The server (GitHub) checks the matching public key.
	•	No passwords are exchanged, and private keys remain private.

How to Implement This for Your App

Option 1: User Generates Key Locally and Uploads Public Key to Your App
	•	Provide clear instructions for users to generate SSH key pairs locally:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"


	•	User copies the public key (contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) and uploads it to your app dashboard.
	•	Your app stores this public key associated with the user.
	•	Your backend adds the user’s public key to the remote server’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file (or manages it via config management).
	•	User can now SSH from your app (or terminal plugin) using their private key locally.

Option 2: Your App Generates Key Pair for the User (Less Recommended)
	•	Your app generates the SSH key pair and provides the private key for download.
	•	Users then have to securely store the private key.
	•	This is less secure because the private key passes through your system.

What You Should Do (Recommended)
	•	Encourage users to generate their own SSH keys locally.
	•	Let them upload only the public key to your app.
	•	On your backend, add these public keys to the servers you control (e.g., AWS EC2 instances).
	•	Use SSH libraries that leverage the user’s private key (or prompt them for passphrase if encrypted).

⸻

Additional Tips
	•	Support multiple public keys per user so they can use multiple devices.
	•	Allow key revocation and rotation to improve security.
	•	Provide a simple UI with instructions and copy-paste boxes for keys.
	•	Use SSH agents (ssh-agent) for secure key management on the client side.
